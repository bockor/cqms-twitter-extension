Software requirements:
----------------------
Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Server

Ensure the below packages are present using "sudo apt install <package-name>"

Paramount packages:
- vim or nano (text file editor)
- tmux (terminal multiplexer)
- ufw (firewall)
- openssh-server (to allow remote interventions)
- ngrep (network sniffer)
- python3-pip (Tool for installing and managing Python3 packages)
- git-all (git is a distibuted software version control system)

Optional packages:
- tree (list contents of directories in a tree-like format)
- htop (interactive process viewer)


System configuration:
---------------------

Get the Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Server ISO image from the Ubuntu web site.

Create a bootable USB flash drive and include the ISO.

Ensure that the machine boots from USB drive.
Ensure that the machine has 2 NIC's.

Install the OS and during the process answer to all questions.

Select "csu-admin" as the primary username.  This acount will have elevated admin rights.

Ensure the system time zone is Europe/Brussels.  Verify and configure using "sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata"

Ensure the system has the latest (security) packages using "sudo apt update" and "sudo apt upgrade"

Configure the Ethernet cards using:
    "sudo vim /etc/netplan"
Apply current netplan config to running system using:
    "sudo netplan --debug "
Check network connectivity using the "ifconfig" or the "ip link" commands.
At this stage I would recommend a rereboot prior proceeding.  "sudo init 6" does the trick.

Install all packages as per the above Software requirements bullet.

Make a directory for our software.
    "mkdir $HOME/cqms"

Install the tweepy Twitter API using:
    "sudo pip3 tweepy"
Verify using "sudo pip3 list --format=columns | grep tweepy"

Download the cqms-twitter-extension from Github website.
Ensure that you're in the $HOME directory using the "pwd" command.
Issue the following command.
    "git clone" https://github.com/bockor/cqms-twitter-extension.git"
This creates a new folder "cqms-twitter-extension" into the $HOME directory.

Copy all files from "cqms-twitter-extension" folder to the "cqms" folder.
    "cp /home/csu-admin/cqms-twitter-extension/* /home/csu-admin/cqms"

Ensure that the /home/csu-admin/cqms/cqms-sniffer file is executable using the "ls -l" command.
    If not, use the "chmod +x /home/csu-admin/cqms/cqms-sniffer" command. 
Ensure that the /home/csu-admin/cqms/cqms-twitter-ext.py file is executable using the "ls -l" command.
    If not, use the "chmod +x /home/csu-admin/cqms/cqms-twitter-ext.py" command. 
Ensure that the /home/csu-admin/cqms/cqms-messages-log-cleanup file is executable using the "ls -l" command.
    If not, use the "chmod +x /home/csu-admin/cqms/cqms-messages-log-cleanup" command. 

Twitter authentication.
Ensure that the "credentials.py" file is populated with genuine Twitter access token and token secret.
The Service Manager should provide these accordingly.


tmux allows to use multiple terminal sessions inside a single terminal.
Start the tmux server with the "tmux" command.
Create panes (splits) using:
<Ctrl>+b % combination for vertical pane
<Ctrl>+b " combination for vertical pane
Navigate through the panes using:
<Ctrl>+b Up|Down|Left|Right Arrow keys
Kill panes and leave tmux using: the "exit" command or the <Ctrl>+b x combination


Start the network sniffer process.
Open a new tmux pane and issue:
    "sudo /home/csu-admin/cqms/cqms-sniffer"

Configure cron jobs.  (Schedules execution of scripts and admin tasks) 
Ensure that you're in the $HOME/cqms directory using the "pwd" command.
Issue now the "crontab cqms-cronjobs" commands.
The "crontab -l" command causes the current crontab to be displayed on standard output.

Start the logger and monitor in real time.
Open a new tmux pane and issue:
    "tail -f /home/csu-admin/cqms/cqms-twitter-ext.log"
