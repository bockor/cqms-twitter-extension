Extend the customer overview screen of a Qmatic Customer Queue Management System to Twitter using Python3 and bash.

    - uses switch port mirroring to not interfere with the Qmatic system
    - uses ngrep to sniff and filter relevant packets of the traffic between the master ticket printer and one of the monitors
    - uses the tweepy Twitter API to update the timeline
    - Linux crontab ensures that the script is executed repeatedly
